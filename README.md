FishCaller
==========

This is a simple circuit that will do short beeps at a few kHz. This should supposedly attract fish.

The inspiration is from this [fish calling kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qwl95RwPuM)
and the circuit was adapted from this [alarm design](http://circuitdiagram.net/beeper-sound.html).

We will try and check if this works.

For more details on the project check the [Mediated
Landscape](http://wiki.biodesign.cc/wiki/Mediated_Landscapes) wiki page.
