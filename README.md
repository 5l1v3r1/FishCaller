FishCaller
==========

This is a simple circuit that will do short beeps at a few kHz. This should supposedly attract fish.

We will try and check if this works.

For more details on the project check the [Mediated
Landscape](http://wiki.biodesign.cc/wiki/Mediated_Landscapes) wiki page.

We are BIODESIGN for the REAL-WORLD and more info can be
